- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GMagne195, you can call me Greg.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in quantitative Macroeconomics and I plan on doing a PhD in France specialized in Labor Macroeconomics.
- To be more specific, my main field of interest is related to firms' & workers' dynamics in a frictional labor market, with job-to-job transition and I am applying this interest on the effect of environemental policies.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning on various techniques related to solutions to big HJB equations, KFE equations.
